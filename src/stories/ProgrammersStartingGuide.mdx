## How to install the project & use components

### Install agroptima-design-system dependency in beta mode

This is suitable in order to check the Design System latest changes on your project without the need of publishing
a new version on npm.

- Download the desired Design System feature branch.
- On the package.json, if the current version is `0.18.0` change it by `0.18.0-beta.1`.
- On the Design System project terminal, run `npm run publish:beta`.
- On your project terminal, run `npm i agroptima-design-system@beta`.
- If you need to apply new changes to the Design System branch, increase the beta version like this `0.18.0-beta.2` and run the previous steps.

The beta mode allows us to work comfortably between the 2 projects and applying new changes or feedback to the Design System components
without the need of publishing it on npm.


### Install agroptima-design-system dependency

On the frontend project's package.json, you can see the `agroptima-design-system` dependency.

After installing all the project dependencies, run `npm i agroptima-design-system@latest` to have the latest version
of the design sytem package.

### Import & use design system components

Import the desired component:

`import { Input } from 'agroptima-design-system/src/atoms/Button'`

Use the desired component:

```
<Button
    type="submit"
    label="Login"
    loading={isSubmitting}
    variant="primary"
/>
```

## Themes

### How to use themes

Themes can be used since 1.0.0 version. The project contains the following themes:
* 🍓 `strawberry`
* 🥜 `pistachio`

In order to use them, you need to add the desired theme class to the main layout container of your project:
```
<div className="strawberry">
    <header>My flavoured project</header>
    <main className="main_class">
        <aside className="aside_class">...</aside>
        <div className="content_class">My content</div>
    </main>
</div>
```

Moreover, on the Design System component stories, by clicking on the `Themes` button from the upper toolbar, themes can be checked independently on each component.
### How to add a new theme

Follow the next steps to add a new theme on the Design System.

**Update the theme colors files**

* The Design team will export the `colors.css` and `color_alias.css` with the new values in CSS variables format.
* On the `color_alias.css` file, take into account the variables are named as expected.
* Finally, on the `themes.css` file, for the new theme, add a class to overwrite the needed colors, such as `primary` and `neutral`.

**Update the Storybook Themes addon configuration**

* On the `preview.tsx` file, on the `themes` object from `withThemeByClassName` add the new theme so Storybook recognises and adds it to the Stories theme switch.

**Update the Colors documentation**

* The Colors documentation showcases the swatches used on all variants and themes. Remember to update `Colors.mdx` and `colors.module.css` in order to reflect the new theme swatches.
