## Indigo Project

### Install agroptima-design-system dependency in beta mode

This is suitable in order to check the Design System latest changes on Indigo Project without the need of publishing
a new version on npm.

- Download the desired Design System feature branch.
- On the package.json, if the current version is `0.18.0` change it by `0.18.0-beta.1`.
- On the Design System project terminal, run `npm run publish:beta`.
- On the Indigo project terminal, run `npm i agroptima-design-system@beta`.
- If you need to apply new changes to the Design System branch, increase the beta version like this `0.18.0-beta.2` and run the previous steps.

The beta mode allows us to work comfortably between the 2 projects and applying new changes or feedback to the Design System components
without the need of publishing it on npm.


### Install agroptima-design-system dependency

On the frontend project's package.json, you can see the `agroptima-design-system` dependency.

After installing all the project dependencies, run `npm i agroptima-design-system@latest` to have the latest version
of the design sytem package.

### Import & use design system components

Import the desired component:

`import { Input } from 'agroptima-design-system/src/atoms/Button'`

Use the desired component:

```
<Button
    type="submit"
    label="Login"
    loading={isSubmitting}
    variant="primary"
/>
```

## Sioux Project

We have been focused on creating prioritized components, learning how Storybook works and behaves, making the Design System independent
from the Indigo project and checking the consumption of components from a single project.

Once we reach the needed checkpoint, we'll continue the integration of the Design System with Sioux project.
