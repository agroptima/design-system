## Indigo Project

### Install agroptima-design-system dependency

On the frontend project's package.json, you can see the `agroptima-design-system` dependency.

After installing all the project dependencies, run `npm i agroptima-design-system@latest` to have the latest version
of the design sytem package.

### Import & use design system components

Import the desired component:

`import { Input } from 'agroptima-design-system/src/atoms/Button'`

Use the desired component:

```
<Button
    type="submit"
    label="Login"
    loading={isSubmitting}
    variant="primary"
/>
```

## Sioux Project

We have been focused on creating prioritized components, learning how Storybook works and behaves, making the Design System independent
from the Indigo project and checking the consumption of components from a single project.

Once we reach the needed checkpoint, we'll continue the integration of the Design System with Sioux project.
