## Get started with our Design System

The design system borns of the collaboration, teamwork and cocreation among <b>designers, programmers and product owners</b>. 

Together, we decide the components needed in our projects as well as the naming to be applied. This way, all departments
speak the same language. 

These decisions are portrayed on the Figma design system project which is considered <b>the only source of truth</b>.

Storybook contains all the designed components built and ready to use for our React projects. It also works as a <b>showcase 
of the agreed components</b> and styles designed on the Figma project, as well as a <b>live documentation for programmers</b>.
