# Component creation workflow

## Style properties conditioned by variants

The following properties are the ones which will change depending on the variant provided:

* Font family
* Border radius
* Colours: Except Error and Success variants colours which are common for all themes

## How does the Design Team work

ðŸŒˆ  <b>The Figma design system is the only source of truth and the collaboration, teamwork and regard among
Designers, Programmers and Product Owners</b> ðŸŒˆ

* All components, variants and states must be designed on the Figma file and consumed by our projects.

* At the code projects <b>we must not imply any component property because of the
  existence of a similar component variant</b>: If you find something missing on the Figma file, ask for it to the design team.
  The designer will be glad to add it.

* The animations wonâ€™t be part of the design system, preferably, they will be added through code libraries or done manually
  by the programmers. Nevertheless, if needed, the designer will be happy to prepare a new Figma document with the components
  animation behaviour.

* When defining new aliases or variables names of the components in the code, take into account the recommended nomenclature
  shown on this [template](https://groupeisagri-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/vvalls/EVaZh6_UNHdGqUuulxvTdbIBXuZKUkW1SvF6vPenbkr8AQ?e=rKb81D).

* We recommend to work with the VScode editor where you can use the [Figma VS code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension)
  to check the designs and copy the components styles and links.

* A design task is created where Laura creates and finishes a component on the Figma design system.

* When a component is ready on the Figma design system, a design team programmer can begin the task to add it to the Storybook code project.
  When the component is ready on Storybook, it can be consumed on the needed project on a new task because of the
  design system being on an independent repo.

* Each component story defined on Storybook will have the preview of its Figma design on the [Design tab](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/design-integrations#view-designs-in-storybook).

* When the component is finished on Storybook code project, the task will be deployed to Chromatic.
  On Jira, it will move to the Design System column, so the designer reviews that everything is ok.

* The accessibility tab which shows issues related with the design of the component will be reviewed by the designer.
  The design team programmers also need to keep an eye on this when setting aria properties.

* When the designer gives us the ok, it will follow the common Jira workflow, so it will move to In Consensus to review the code.
